I’ve recently discovered that people are generally annoyed at my constant nagging and lecturing about their investments, their shopping habits, their housing choice, their food choice, and whatever opinion-forming-bandwagon I’m on at the time. But most importantly, most people are simply not ready to hear it.

Now, when I say most I really mean most. Some people, given the right topic at the right time, will not only listen to everything I have to say, but ask follow up questions. This is a strong signal that they do care. But the reason has nothing to do with me nor my approach nor the information that I so elegantly presented. It just happened to be the right thing at the right time.

Recently, I’ve tried to be a little more flexible and understanding towards people. Instead of dumping facts on them and have it backfire and have them hate me, I try to bring things up slowly and gauge their interest. I may even drop by always controversial opinion in there to see if they bite. If they don’t I move on.
