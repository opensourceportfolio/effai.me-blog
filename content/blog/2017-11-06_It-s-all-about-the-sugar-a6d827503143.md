I guess I gave away the punch line for this blog post right from the title but the more I learn about this topic, the more I am convinced that all modern chronic disease is rooted in a single problem (generally). It’s our obsessive over consumption of sugar and refined carbohydrates.

Now, despite some resistance from the dark vegan armies, I’m pretty sure it’s obvious that diabetes and over consumption of sugar is closely related. In fact, I would go as far as to say that it’s a root cause of our exploding rate of type II diabetes. It makes perfect sense yet still remains controversial and unresolved.

Next we move on to heart disease. The number one killer in the world. That one I admit is a little more complicated but still I would implicate sugar as the cause. Studies in this space tend to be observational so there are no hard proofs but a lot of things seem to be aligning. For example, [insulin resistance and heart disease are closely related](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15983261).

Now for some stretch goals. First, there’s cancer. I’m going based of this video but seems damn convincing to me.

If a cancer cell requires abnormal amounts of glucose and we don’t provide it, it should starve. If we feed it, its growth should be promoted. Makes perfect sense.

And finally there’s this whole discussion on Alzheimer’s being [type 3 diabetes.](http://www.diabetes.co.uk/type3-diabetes.html) Which is again just an implication of sugar being the root cause. This is again pretty early on and light on true detailed studies but it makes sense considering you bought the above.

So having said this, what do we have as a treatment option? Easy, stop eating sugar and cut down your carbohydrate consumption.
