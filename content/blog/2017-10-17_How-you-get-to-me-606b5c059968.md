I’ve recently done a lunch and learn at work and presented everything I know about heart disease. It was a ton of fun and I felt great after it. One fear that I had though is the way meetings tend to run in corporate environments. Usually, you have a bunch of people around a table, staring at their laptops while one person talks for 30–60 minutes.

Now I love listening to my own voice just as much as the next guy. Possibly even more then the next guy. However, I didn’t want my presentation to turn to something boring and unproductive. Not only would I find it demoralizing, but I’ve also just wasted the time of every attendee.

To my surprise, not only were most people paying close attention to what I was saying, but they actually did what in my opinion is the biggest signal to let someone know you’re paying attention. They asked followup questions! That’s a big deal in my book. It shows that you’re aware of the context and you’re thinking. You realize something isn’t covered and you are curious to know more.

Thankfully, my presentation involved a lot of followup questions and I was more then happy to dive a little deeper and explain it all. Overall a fantastic experience and I’d love to do it again.
