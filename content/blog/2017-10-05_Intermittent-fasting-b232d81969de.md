[Dr. Jason Fung](https://medium.com/u/67900d58acac) is one of my internet heroes for sure. I also recently discovered High Intensity Health on YouTube and can’t recommend it enough. It’s super insightful and the interviews are detailed but not too detailed so you never feel like you’re back in University.

This video talks about intermittent fasting and treating type 2 diabetes. Personally, I like to do short daily intermittent fasts. I do this by skipping breakfast and eating much dinner before 7 pm. That way I fast from 7 pm until lunch time (12 pm) the next day. That works out to roughly 16 — 17 hour fast.
