My wife keeps insisting that knowing other people’s salaries is a bad idea. You just set yourself up for misery. Her reasoning is that someone will always make more and you’ll always feel like you need to make more too to match up and you’ll never be happy with what you have.

She is absolutely right (generally speaking). This is exactly how someone is bound to feel when finding out colleagues are making more while doing the same job. This is also completely independent of how you felt prior about your salary; An unfortunate human quirk.

However, once you’re aware of this quirk, I feel like you can take advantage of it. Instead of sulking in your misery, you can do much better. You can make the following realization step by step.

1.  Nothing has changed in your conditions.
2.  If you were happy with your salary before you should be happy now.
3.  There is potential to make even **more** money so you should be even happier.
