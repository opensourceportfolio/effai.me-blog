I had a short discussion with my mom’s friend’s son today. He just started university and had all these questions about expectations. I, as the “mature” adult tried to provide him with some pointers. Of course, I tried to keep it honest as well. I don’t think anyone wants to hear generic, meaningless, motivational quotes. I know I don’t.

I wanted to provide him with something useful and applicable. Most importantly, I wanted it to resonate with him. There was only one thing I could think of to say. I first admitted that I wasn’t a very good student. I didn’t study much and I crammed for exams. I learned just enough to do okay but would forget most of it the second I walked out of that exam room.

I also mentioned that he will probably feel the need to do the same. That’s just how people do it in university. It just doesn’t have to be the only way. Another way to look at it is you are spending your hard earned money to be there. We’ve also determined previously that money = time. If you’re going to spend your time on something, make sure it’s worth it. It’s a finite resource after all.

I didn’t dive too deep into the finite resource portion because that might not resonate as well with a 21 year old but the rest is true. No one likes to just waste their time. Therefore; if you’re going somewhere, make sure you get the most out of it. I feel like it stuck!
