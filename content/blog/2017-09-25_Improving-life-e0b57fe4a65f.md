Continuing on the previous idea of happiness by subtraction, what can you really do? I had this conversation with my wife the other day. She mentioned how much she doesn’t like to do laundry, cleaning and dishes.

Based on the idea if subtraction, we should do our best to eliminate these tasks. Notice that nothing is being added to our lives. I am not suggesting we get cleaner, more dishes or more dish washers (yet).

So what can you do? Here’s my rough framework. Keep in mind that I came up with it in about 15 minutes on a car ride so it may or may not be complete. I am likely to address the holes later. Long story short, you have 3 options:

1.  Elimination
2.  Automation
3.  Outsourcing

They are in a rough order of desirability. Option (1), elimination, usually won’t cost much if at all. It alleviates a lot of problems and adult responsibilities.

Option (2) is great if possible. It may or may not cost you but aside from a little of annual maintenance usually frees up a bunch of time.

Option (3) tends to be the most expensive one. However, certain things are simply cannot be eliminated or automated (although that’s changing).

Regarding my wife’s biggest pain points, elimination didn’t seem to work but I could definitely think of some partial automation solutions that we will explore.
